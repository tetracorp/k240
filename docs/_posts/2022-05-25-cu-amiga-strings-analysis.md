### String change analysis

38, 40, 60
: The power building descriptions refer to the Power Amplifier as the Power
Doubler, possibly an old name. The blueprint itself is already named Power
Amplifier in the demo.

69
: In the demo, there is a message when a button is extracted and one when an
extracted button is removed. A "boop" sound plays in both cases. In the final
version, removing a button has no message and plays a click sound. The empty
string entry was re-used for the text "SELECT 'ALIEN' AND CHOOSE A SCENARIO".

215
: String changed for demo features.

216
: A blank entry appears for the fleet sentry mode. The demo uses the previous
string.

223, 250, 251
: String names for "TURRET", "TURRET1", and "TURRET2", appearing in the alien
stats. The gap between 223 and 250 suggests the addition of two alternate
turrets was a later addition, and that they were never given specific names. The
string "TURRET" was placed back in with string 357 in an additional batch of
alien building names. The original turret strings  appear to have been deleted,
leaving gaps for starting blueprint string and alternate game over text, which
was probably added quite late.

272
: Text used when a colony has been destroyed by a Mega missile - "BY A DEEP
SPACE MISSILE" in the demo, but "BLOWN TO PIECES!" This makes it ambigious how
the colony was destroyed. This might be because one of the Swixaran large ships
has a self-destruct hardpoint that works as a Mega missile.

291, 292, 310
: Inbound ship, missile, and fleet warning. In the demo, this caused a text
popup. In the full game, these are replaced with voice clips which don't
interrupt the game. The ship and missile text strings are simply removed in the
final version, and the fleet warning is replaced with the standard win text.

307, 349
: The abbreviation for "credits" changed from "CR" to "CD".

314, 315
: Game over strings for the demo only. Left empty in the full version.

318
: Comet warning text. The final game does not warn you about comets. Final
version adds some additional win screen text into the unused slot.

355
: "Rapidly declining population" used to suggest "This may be due to high
radiation!" The final game doesn't do this. This may be because other things can
cause rapidly declining population, such as certain alien weapons.

356
: The original disk request used the byte `\x01` to represent the disk number.
The final game uses that character for the symbol Ç in French translation. The
character is changed to "x", since it's replaced with the disk number anyway.

366
: A warning that the save game disk is not Amiga formatted disk. The demo has
internal strings referring to save games on `df0:`, so it was already intended
at this point to save game to a standard-formatted Amiga floppy disk. The demo
refers to a format the disk, which did not appear in the final game, perhaps to
avoid players accidentally formatting over their game disk. The drawback is that
you need a pre-formatted disk prepared to save on.

391
: Error message shown when you try to build on an asteroid you don't own. "No
colony on this asteroid" became "no active CPU on this asteroid". This may be
because the most common case is trying to build after you've colonized an
asteroid but the C.P.U. hasn't finished building yet.

412
: One of several notices that a feature is unavailable in the demo. This is the
blueprint "[PURCHASED]" text, but it's been repurposed to notify the player tha
the feature has been disabled.

451, 452, 453, 454, 455, 456 458, 479, 480, 481, 482
: More notices of features disable in the demo. These are the most recent text
strings in the numbered index of the demo. A few others appear subsequently in
memory, but are not in the demo's string index. Replaced in the final version
with new alien building names and intel screen text.

457
: In the demo, this says "UNKNOWN!", perhaps originally used as dummy text for
the Intel screen. Replaced with "TURRET", which covers all alien turrets.

483 - 502
: First text not to have any numeric equivalent in the demo. Text strings from
this point on reflect features added to the game after the demo was build circa
Jan 1994. These in particular are Intel screen spy satellite report strings.

503 - 520
: Rigellian building names.

521 - 535
: Swixaran building names.

536, 537
: Swixaran self-destruct ship hardpoint warnings.

538, 539
: Swixaran ghost fleet notifications.

540
: Swixaran asteroid cloak string.

541 - 547
: Last minute intelligence text. Presumably added to account for things not
mentioned in the game manual.

548 - 553
: Manual protection code text.

554
: "Fleet is not orbitting the current asteroid!" A rarely used text, presumably
for when ordering a fleet to guard an asteroid they aren't at.

561
: Abbreviation for credits changed from "CR" to "CD". Note that the demo
hardcodes the starting text string as 3,740,000, which is also the default
starting money in the demo. The full game just replaces them with the letter
"x", since it's changed when the game begins anyway.

564, 565
: Enabling and disabling speech. The string in this approximate location
in the demo says "TETRACORP SYSTEMS STATUS..."

568
: Another notice of features unavailable in the demo, used for the save game
text in the full game.

569 - 584
: Load, save, and exit game text strings in the full game. Two demo strings
574-575 say "USED." and "FREE.", referring to memory or disk usage.

593
: The text string for the bottom of the Tetracorp page, with the text for "LOAD
SAVE ALIEN FX", etc. The difference is that the demo says "QUIT GAME END",
whereas the full version adds a speech toggle button, saying SPEECH DOS END.
This is the last text string in the demo.

594, 595, 596
: More Intel report strings which only appear in the final strings. This
certainly confirms that Intel features were added very late in development.

597, 598, 599, 600, 601
: New game strings in the full game only, used when starting a new game or
abandoning an old game in progress to select a new alien.

602
: Full version only. Notification that you haven't got enough memory to enable
speech.

603, 604, 605
: Full version only. Manual protection and save game file naming.

### Other text strings

Other text strings not in the text list include:

| Demo version     | Full version            |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| CON:0/10/630/120/K240 - (c) 1993 Gremlin Graphics. | CON:0/40/635/120/K240 - (c) 1994 Gremlin Graphics. |
| ENTER HELP CODE: |                         |
| ENTER SHIP 1-7:  | ENTER SHIP 1-8:         |
| ENTER SFX A-Z:   | TEST: ENTER SFX A-W:    |
|                  | TEST: ENTER SPEECH A-U: |

- Copyright changed from 1993 to 1994. The game was originally intended to be
  completed in 1993. It may suggest that the demo build was made as early as
  1993, but since the console invocation is practically never seen and has no
  effect on gameplay, it would be easy to miss.
- `ENTER HELP CODE` suggests that cheat codes existed at the time of the demo,
  but had been disabled. The original feature may have been to press a key
  (perhaps the Amiga's Help key) to trigger cheat code entry.
- `ENTER SHIP 1-7` shows that at one point, there were only seven ships. This is
  probably prior to the implementation of the Orbital Space Dock (although the
  OSD does appear in the demo).
- `ENTER SFX A-Z` does not necessarily mean there are 26 sound samples; in fact,
  the satellite silo launch audio is missing from the demo.
- `ENTER SPEECH A-U` only appears in the full version. There was evidently no
  voice test in the demo.
