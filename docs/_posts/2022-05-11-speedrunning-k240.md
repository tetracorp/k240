At time of writing, there is a small
[Amiga speedrunning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdArUM1DAA_7EE_5ozEPcuTWms4ICWo-F)
community, although I am not aware of anyone speedrunning K240 in particular.
Here are some suggestions and strategies.

### Platform standardization

Naturally, K240 v2.000 should be used, since v1.886 suffers from the 
[fleet bug](../game-mechanics/bugs.html#fleet-bug), which can either end a run or
waste time mitigating the bug by decommissioning fleets. It is also likely that
the Amiga community would accept emulation, rather than requiring the game be
played on original hardware. An emulated Amiga 1200 with a hard disk install
would be entirely within the original intent of the gameplay experience.
However, there is a question of whether an expanded emulated Amiga is
legitimate, since it could in theory run the game faster than any real Amiga, or
if WHDLoad is allowed.

### Manual protection

The decision on whether or not to allow cracked manual-protected copies would
also need to be standardized. A pirate copy is not playing the game as the
developers intended, although it was common at the time.

It's possible to memorize the
[manual protection codes](../data/manual-protection-codes.html). Although the
English manual is 28,447 words, only 100 words are stored in the game for each
language. Additionally, you need only memorize the page and line, since the
English version never uses two words from the same line. German has two on the
same line on page 164 and French has two on page 210.

### Any%, 100%, and glitchless categories

Completing K240 only requires you to defeat the Swixarans. The hidden Swixaran
home asteroid is always located in the space between the two asteroids with
cloak generators, so I believe the optimal strategy is to Asteroid Engine it.
You still need to defeat all the other Swixaran asteroids to win, however.

As speedrunners tend to prefer whichever metric results in the lowest time, I
imagine the Any% run begins when you click to continue on the Last Minute Intel
screen, and ends when the win screen graphic appears. By this metric, the de
facto initial record holder is 
[Thiima's 2009 run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oc7zqEgF4ko&list=PL04BD4BBE079FF6AD&index=1)
at 1h 57m 2s.

A 100% run would require defeating aliens 1-5 in any order, followed by the
Swixarans. It would require more player skill to avoid bad luck ending a run.

I'm not aware of any exploitable glitches yet. The cheat codes would naturally
be forbidden, meaning that you cannot use PANEL cheat to set up the UI
conveniently at the start of the game.

### Optimizations

Asteroid Engines are probably the most cost-effective weapon. A new colony plus
an Asteroid Engine costs 75,000 credits.
