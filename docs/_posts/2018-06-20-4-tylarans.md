The Tylarans are a medium-difficulty race with a slow rate of expansion.

### Unique traits

The Tylarans do not use missiles, and do not mine.

They do not have any specific building to produce food, air or water, and can
survive without Habitat as long as their Control Centre survives. They are
resistant to radiation, 

As long as there is at least one Habitat, Tylarans gain 2 population per day, to
a maximum of 200 per Habitat. They are resistant to radiation, losing one
colonist per day if radiation is 50% or higher, but this does not prevent new
population, meaning population can grow by 1 per day even with high radiation.

The Tylarans possess a technology which repels missiles to random asteroids.
Since the game treats spy satellites in transit as missiles, this can even repel
a spy satellite.

![tyl_missile_silo_anim](../images/alien_ships/tyl_missile_silo_anim.gif "tyl_missile_silo_anim"){:.right}

A unique quirk of the Tylarans is that you can fire missiles at asteroids you
have not yet discovered, but which you can see via the Telescope cheat. This may
be a feature added for testing purposes.

They possess a unique golden Vortex Mine ship hardpoint. Since they don't use
missiles, the missile launch sprite slot is used for the golden Vortex storm
graphic.

### Buildings

Each alien building has a name, a type (as it counts on a spy satellite report),
Hit Points, build time (in days), a height (for the purpose of scaffold), a
width (1, for one-square, or 4 for a 2x2 building), a softcap (buildings marked
! have a hard cap instead), and the building at the equivalent position in the
Terran building list.

Control Centre
: ![Control Centre](../images/alien_bldg/tyl_control_centre_4sq.gif "control centre"){:.left} Colony must have at least one Control Centre or Habitat, or be destroyed.

Data Gatherer
: ![Data Gatherer](../images/alien_bldg/tyl_data_gatherer.gif "data gatherer"){:.left} Increases the chances of spotting Terran spy satellites. The base chance is 1%
plus a cumulative 1% per day, and each Data Gatherer adds an additional chance
per day, although a colony will never build more than one.

Energiser
: ![Energiser](../images/alien_bldg/tyl_energiser.gif "energiser"){:.left} Offensive category building. Every 60 days, all Energisers trigger, making a
noise like a Static Inducer.

Fleet Factory
: ![Fleet Factory](../images/alien_bldg/tyl_fleet_factory_4sq.gif "fleet factory"){:.left} A shipyard. A maximum of four per colony can operate. Requires either a Power
Collector or Power Generator.

Fluxxer
: ![Fluxxer](../images/alien_bldg/tyl_fluxxer.gif "fluxxer"){:.left} A power type building required to build ships.

Force Field Node
: ![Force Field Node](../images/alien_bldg/tyl_force_field_node.gif "force field node"){:.left} Screen Generator. Halves all building damage to covered buildings, assuming it
works like the Terran equivalent. Has a soft cap of 2 per asteroid.

Habitat
: ![Habitat](../images/alien_bldg/tyl_habitat.gif "habitat"){:.left} Each Habitat holds up to 200 colonists. If there are no Habitats, the colony
can still survive, losing one colonist per day. This fits the lore of Tylarans
being at home in the cold of space. If there are no Habitat or Control Centre,
the colony is destroyed.

Power Collector
: ![Power Collector](../images/alien_bldg/tyl_power_collector_4sq.gif "power collector"){:.left} A powerplant. A Power Collector or Power Generator is required to build ships.

Power Generator
: ![Power Generator](../images/alien_bldg/tyl_power_generator.gif "power generator"){:.left} Equivalent to a solar panel. A Power Collector or Power Generator is required
to build ships.

Proton Launcher
: ![Proton Launcher](../images/alien_bldg/tyl_proton_launcher.gif "proton launcher"){:.left} An unknown "General" type building. Often built alongside a Warp Manipulator.

Rad Shield
: ![Rad Shield](../images/alien_bldg/tyl_rad_shield.gif "rad shield"){:.left} Reduces radiation by 30%. If radiation is 50% or higher, the colony loses one
colonist per day (but new colonists can still be produced, at a rate of 2/day,
for a net gain of 1 colonist). Since the housing and power checks occur first,
population losses to radiation are ignored if there's a housing or power
shortage.

Science Facility
: ![Science Facility](../images/alien_bldg/tyl_science_facility.gif "science facility"){:.left} Unknown.

Seismic Atomiser
: ![Seismic Atomiser](../images/alien_bldg/tyl_seismic_atomiser.gif "seismic atomiser"){:.left} An Offensive type building. Mines eight ore per day, starting with the rarest
types.

Thrusters
: ![Thrusters](../images/alien_bldg/tyl_thrusters_4sq.gif "thrusters"){:.left} Asteroid engines observed to allow travel at speeds of up to 8. Require at
least one Power Collector or Power Generator.

Turret
: ![Turret](../images/alien_bldg/tyl_turret.gif "turret"){:.left} A laser turret which deals 4 damage, twice as powerful as the Terran laser
turret. Fires on a 6-day cooldown.

Turret
: ![Turret](../images/alien_bldg/tyl_turret2.gif "turret"){:.left} A plasma turret which deals 6 damage, 20% more powerful than the Terran plasma
turret. Fires on a 6-day cooldown.

Turret
: ![Turret](../images/alien_bldg/tyl_turret3.gif "turret"){:.left} A photon turret which deals 10 damage, 20% more powerful than the Terran
photon turret. Fires on a 6-day cooldown.

Warp Manipulator
: ![Warp Manipulator](../images/alien_bldg/tyl_warp_manipulator.gif "warp manipulator"){:.left} Unknown Defence type building. Reacts to incoming missiles 32% of the time.
This appears to be the technology which reflects incoming missiles. Often built
alongside Proton Launcher.

### Building strategy

The Tylarans build more slowly than any other species, with each asteroid
attempting a new build every 70 days. They do not require currency or ore to
build (in fact, they do not mine). When there is no particular need, they
randomly build one of the following clusters of four buildings:

* 0: Proton Launcher, Warp Manipulator, Turret (Laser), Power Generator
* 1: Habitat, Power Collector, Habitat, Control Centre
* 2: Fleet Factory, Fluxxer, Power Generator, Turret (Plasma)
* 3: Thrusters, Seismic Atomiser, Turret (Photon), Power Collector
* 4: Rad Shield, Force Field Node, Turret (Photon), Turret (Plasma)
* 5: Energiser, Turret (Photon), Turret (Plasma), Power Generator
* 6: Science Facility, Turret (Laser), Data Gatherer, Habitat
* 7: Warp Manipulator, Turret (Photon), Fleet Factory, Rad Shield

Each building has a 100% chance to be placed until it reaches the cap for that
building type, with a 15% chance to ignore the cap, except for Data Gatherer,
Thrusters, and Control Centre, which are hard capped at 1 per colony.

The Tylarans have a more complex decision-making process when it comes to
buildings than most aliens. They are slow to react to emergencies, placing
build priority after 32 days instead of 16 days like most aliens.

If there are no Power Collector or Power Generator, or no Habitat, the colony
sets its priority to build cluster 1: Habitat x2, Power Collector, and Control
Centre. They do not appear to have a food building.

If radiation is 50% or higher, they set priority to build cluster 7: Warp
Manipulator, Turret (Photon), Fleet Factory and Rad Shield.

Otherwise, unless a certain flag is set, it builds at random. If that flag is
set, building priorities shift as follows:

If there is a power or housing shortage, it builds cluster 1 as normal. If there
is a radiation problem, it switches to cluster 4 (Rad Shield, Force Field Node,
Turret (Photon), and Turret (Plasma).

Otherwise, it builds cluster 3 (Thrusters, Seismic Atomiser, Turret (Photon),
and Power Collector); unless there is already a Thrusters, then it builds
cluster 4; unless there is already a Force Field Node, then it builds set 5
(Energiser, Turret (Photon), Turret (Plasma), Power Generator).

### Missiles

Tylarans are the only alien which do not use missiles. They have no equivalent
to Weapons Factory or Missile Silo.

An specific quirk is that when using the TELESCOPE
[cheat](../game-mechanics/cheats.html) to see asteroids you have not yet
discovered, the Tylarans are the only enemy where you can fire at the
undiscovered asteroids. Normally, your missiles disappear unless you have
actually detected the asteroids with sensors, scoutship, or a freak sensor scan
event.

### Ships

To make progress on ship construction, each Tylaran colony requires at least one
Power Collector or Power Generator. It also requires one Fluxxer. It requires at
least one Fleet Factory, and can use up to four Fleet Factories to speed
construction. Notably, since they do not build missiles, they do not have a
Weapons Factory equivalent, and do not require one for shipbuilding.

Each ship an Armour value, speed, number of hardpoints (sometimes erroneous), ID
number in the game code, chance to build, build time, and up to six hardpoints.
The names here are arbitrary and do not appear in the code.

Ship $3c "Fighter"
: ![tyl_ship_small_1](../images/alien_ships/tyl_ship_small_1.gif "tyl_ship_small_1"){:.left}
A fast 20 Armour ship with a Plasma Cannon (6 damage).

Ship $3d "Blue Dragon"
: ![tyl_ship_small_2](../images/alien_ships/tyl_ship_small_2.gif "tyl_ship_small_2"){:.left}
A fast 30 Armour ship with Photon Cannon (10 damage), Ion Cannon, and Vortex
Mine.

Ship $3e ~~"Red Dragon"~~
: ![tyl_ship_small_3](../images/alien_ships/tyl_ship_small_3.gif "tyl_ship_small_3"){:.left}
A slower 40 Armour ship with four hardpoints: a Photon Cannon (10 damage),
Laser Cannon (4 damage), Ion Cannon, and Napalm Orb. Never built randomly, and
appears to be dummied out.

Ship $3f "Scoutship"
: ![tyl_ship_small_4](../images/alien_ships/tyl_ship_small_4.gif "tyl_ship_small_4"){:.left}
A slower 5 Armour ship with a Laser Cannon (4 damage). Exceptionally weak among
alien scoutships. Each colony sends out a scoutship every 40 days, which is
quite slow.

Ship $40 "Small Transporter"
: ![tyl_ship_med_5](../images/alien_ships/tyl_ship_med_5.gif "tyl_ship_med_5"){:.left}
A slower 30 Armour ship with a Photon Cannon (10 damage) and Plasma Cannon (6
damage). Its number is swapped with the previous ship in the game data. A long
narrow ship. Despite its small size, this is a Transporter, which starts new
colonies. Colonies started by this ship appear to be military outposts which do
not engage in mining, missile construction, or shipbuilding, and may to be
intentionally founded for the purpose of asteroid crashing.

Ship $41 "Gold Dragon"
: ![tyl_ship_med_6](../images/alien_ships/tyl_ship_med_6.gif "tyl_ship_med_6"){:.left}
A slower 50 Armour ship with four hardpoints: Static Inducer, Plasma Cannon (6
damage), Vortex Mine, and a unique golden Tylaran Vortex Mine. Has the incorrect
number in the game data, but this is ignored in the game code, and if you
generate a ship 41 it appears as this ship.  A wide ship that looks like two
side-by-side.

Ship $42 "Transporter"
: ![tyl_ship_transporter](../images/alien_ships/tyl_ship_transporter.gif "tyl_ship_transporter"){:.left}
A slow 20 Armour ship with two Photon Cannons (10 damage).

Ship $43 "Battleship"
: ![tyl_ship_battleship](../images/alien_ships/tyl_ship_battleship.gif "tyl_ship_battleship"){:.left}
A slow 100 Armour ship with six hardpoints: Two Plasma Cannons (10 damage), two
unique golden Tylaran Vortex Mines, one regular Vortex Mine, and an Ion Cannon.

### Starting resources

When facing the Tylarans, the player starts with the following resources:

* Cash: 250,000 credits (default)
* Blueprints: Asteroid Tracker, Missile Guidance System, Powerplant

The alien colony begins with the following building clusters:

* 1: Habitat, Power Collector, Habitat, Control Centre
* 2: Fleet Factory, Fluxxer, Power Generator, Turret (Plasma)

They start with the following ships:

* $3f "Scoutship" x1
* $40 "Heavy Fighter" x1
* $41 "Gold Dragon" x1
* $42 "Transporter?" x1

### Colonization strategy

Each Tylaran colony considers starting a new colony every 45 days. There is a 5%
chance each time that it creates a new colony. The initial colony takes 80 days
to activate, and each new colony takes 40 days to activate.

A new colony builds the following cluster of buildings:

* 1: Habitat, Power Collector, Habitat, Control Centre

### Mining strategy

The Tylarans do not mine. They have no buildings for mining or storing ore.

### Population

Population increases by 2 per day, to a maximum of 200 per Habitat. If there are
no Habitats, they instead lose population at a rate of 1 per day. They also lose
1 population if radiation is 50% or higher, although as long as they are gaining
2 per day from Habitats, this still results in a net gain of 1 per day. The
colony requires at least one Control Center or Habitat to survive, otherwise the
colony is immediately destroyed.

### Spying

Each colony has a daily chance to spot one Terran spy satellite in orbit and
shoot it down. The chance begins at 1% and increases by 1% per 16 days. Once
they shoot a satellite down, the chance drops to 6%.

The daily chance is increased by 1% per 16 days for each Data Gatherer.

### Scouting

Every 40 days, each colony sends a scout ship to explore a random sector of space.

### Tactical

The Tylarans are unique in that they do not use missiles at all. They have no
sensors which react to incoming missiles or fleets in the usual sense.

If any of our asteroids are known, Thrusters are fired at speed 8 and the
colony's natural Gravity Nullifier effect is disabled.

Every 60 days, every Energiser triggers. This countdown is shared between all
colonies with an Energiser, and nothing else happens on Energiser days.

Every 10 days divided by the number of colonies, a proximity trigger checks for
the risk of asteroid collisions, and evacuates all fleets. However, colonies
founded by the small Transporter ship do not bother with evacuation protocols,
and may in fact have been founded specifically for asteroid ramming.

On other days, every 14 days fleets are formed at any colony with at least 8
available ships, and forms fleets of 0-14 ships. Their retreat value is 100%.

### Art inspiration

![The Second Experiment](../images/The_Second_Experiment.jpg "The Second Experiment"){:width="180px"}
{:.right}

The design of the Tylarans appears to have been inspired by
[an artwork](https://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?898345) by science fiction
illustrator Peter A. Jones, which appears on the cover of  Panther Science
Fiction's 1975 publication of _The Second Experiment_ by J. O. Jeppson (ISBN
0-586-04316-0).
It appeared on page 2 of Jones' 1980 art anthology, _Solar Wind_.

It was not unheard of for science fiction artists to license their past works
for use in video game art. While some of Peter Jones' art was licensed for use
in video game cover art around this time, he is not specifically credited in
K240.

Below is a comparison between the alien as it appears in the game, and the
artwork:
