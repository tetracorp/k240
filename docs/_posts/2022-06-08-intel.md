Intel features appear very late in the game data sections (sprite data, building
list, text string list, ship orders list, button list, etc), so it's a
reasonable deduction that they were not added until relatively late in the
game's development.

### Spy satellites

![Satellite Silo](../images/buildings/satellite_silo.gif "Satellite Silo")
{:.right}

Each alien asteroid checks for spy satellites once every 16 days (specifically,
on days ending in 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, and 96). If there is at least one spy
satellite orbiting the asteroid, the chance of detection increases by 1% before
each check. The base chance is effectively 1%, so the first check has a 2%
chance, the second 3%, and so on.

Certain buildings aid the alien in detecting the spy satellite. These do not
chance the percentage chance, but grant another check attempt at the same
percentage chance:

1. Kll-Kp-Qua: Data Hive
2. Ore Eaters: Detection Cluster
3. Ax'zilanths: Sensory Matrix and Subspace Detectors
4. Tylarans: Data Gatherer
5. Rigellians: Probes
6. Swixarans: Receptor Cells

The Kll-Kp-Qua also gains an additional check for each triangular rotating ship
in orbit.

If the check is successful, the alien removes one satellite. The detection
chance is reset to effectively 6%, meaning it will be 7% on next check. The
alien stops making checks once one is destroyed, even if it has more rolls left,
i.e. it can only shoot down one spy satellite every 16 days.

When Swixarans destroy a spy satellite, it sets byte 91 bit 4 in the asteroid's
data, which sets a flag for retaliation. They intentionally target the player's
most populated asteroid out of all those known to them, and launch a missile
strike containing 1-4 Explosive missiles, 1-4 sabotage missiles which deal
damage over time, 1-4 sensor array destroying missiles, and 1-2 bioweapons which
kill 50 colonists each.

### Spy reports

Each question asked increases the spy satellite detection chance at that
asteroid by 1%.

A spy report caches the answer, so asking a second time just gives the same
answer without increasing the detection chance again or billing the player a
second time. If the player leaves the Intel screen and interrogates the spy
satellite again, they pay again.

Intel reports have a 50% chance to be inaccurate.

Population
: 8,000 CD. Gives the number of colonists, rounded down to the nearest multiple
of 16. An inaccurate report will give a random number between 0 and 999, rounded
down to the nearest multiple of 16.

Missile inventory
: 15,000 CD. Missiles are categorized by yield as follows: Low (Explosive), Med
(Area Explosive, Napalm, Scatter, Vortex), High (Hellfire, Nuclear, Mega), and
Other (Stasis, Virus). For the
[Kll-Kp-Qua](https://tetracorp.github.io/k240/alien/1-kll-kp-qua.html) only,
Scatter is classified as High instead of Med. Each alien also has unique
missiles detailed in its page at this site. An inaccurate report varies each
category result by a number between -4 and +3 (minimum 0).
In certain cases, since aliens can only have 5 of each missile, an inaccurate
report can be identified as such if it gives a higher number than possible. This
includes any Low missiles for the Ax'Zilanths or Swixarans, more than 5 Other
for the Kll-Kp-Qua, or more than 5 Low for the Ore Eaters, Rigellians, or
Swixarans.

Number of enemy asteroids
: 30,000 CD. An inaccurate report will give a random number of asteroids between
1 and 4.

Our asteroids known to enemy
: 40,000 CD. An inaccurate report will randomly select 4 colonies and have a 50%
chance of showing each one as known to the enemy.

Building inventory
: 8,000 CD. The exact categorization of buildings varies by alien and is
detailed in the specific alien pages at this site. An inaccurate report varies
each category result by a number between -6 and +5 (minimum 0).

Makeup of deployed fleet
: 25,000 CD. Does not charge or make an inaccurate report if there is no
deployed fleet. Report is divided into battleships and all other ships. Each
alien has only one class of ship which counts as their battleship. An inaccurate
report will vary the number of battleships by between -2 and +1 (minimum 0), and
vary the number of other ships by between -10 and +9 (minimum 5).

Destination of deployed fleet
: 25,000 CD. Does not charge or make an inaccurate report if there is no
deployed fleet. An inaccurate report will name a random colony.

Destination of missile strike
: 25,000 CD. Does not charge or make an inaccurate report if there is no missile
strike. An inaccurate report will name a random colony.

If you put a satellite on your own colony, it will remain there for the rest of
the game, or the colony is destroyed. The only practical use of a satellite on
your own colony is that you can use it to make a "Number of enemy asteroids" or
"Our asteroids known to enemy" check. Building inventory checks on your own
asteroid will mark all buildings as General, and missile inventory checks will
use the current alien categories for those missile IDs.

If you put a satellite on an empty asteroid, it will remain there if an alien
later colonizes it, allowing you to see it immediately. The only real cost is
2 Barium and 10,000 credits from your Intel budget, and a risk of Swixaran
retaliation when they find out you've been spying on them.

### Spying with scoutships

The scoutship has the ability to spy on enemy asteroids and reveal the total
number of buildings, ships, transporters, and battleships. It's free and
safe for the scoutship, and unlike spy satellites, the scout will never give
misinformation.

The scoutship caches the report as it was when it observed the asteroid, and
does not deliver it until it arrives home. In other words, if you send a scout
to spy on an asteroid and it sees 12 buildings, and you destroy all the
buildings with Nuclear missiles before the scout gets back, the scout will still
report 12 buildings.

If you happen to spy on your own asteroid this way, it will report the number of
buildings correctly, but not the number of ships, since it's counting alien
ships.
